About this library:
- This library is intended for educational purposes, and may be useful if you are learning or teaching others to program games.
- All examples are built using the PICO-8 game engine: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php
- PICO-8 runs on the Lua programming language: https://www.lua.org/
- Much of what you learn using these tools can be applied to other languages and engines.

Using the library:
- Examples are organized as sets relating to common game formats, such as top-down and side-scrolling perspectives.
- Each set is available as a .zip file that contains several PICO-8 (.p8) files.
- You can also download the individual .p8 files a la carte.

Loading an example:
1. In a web browser, go to: https://www.pico-8-edu.com/
2. Press the play button to access a command line interface, then type LOAD
3. A dialog box will appear, allowing you to browse for a file
4. Press ESC to toggle between the command line and the PICO-8 editor.
5. Press CTRL R to run the game.

Workflow:
- Press P to pause a running game or ESC to return to the editor.
- If you make any changes using the editor, you can download your file from the command line using SAVE <FILENAME>
- You can also view the game code by opening a .p8 file in a text editor or code editor like Visual Studio Code.

Students/Learners:
- If you're new to programming, I recommend starting with either the "intro_to_game_programming" or "paddleball_basic" sets.
- The "intro_to_game_programming" set introduces core concepts related to game progamming, such as variables, functions, etc.
- The numbered examples in the intro set build up to moving, animating, and interacting with game objects.
- The other sets include numbered step-by-step examples leading to the construction of a basic template in the given game format.
- There are also unnumbered examples showcasing common features that can be built on top of the basic template.
- Set a goal of reproducing the basic template first. Download it, play it, and read through the code to become familiar with it.
- Once you are familiar with the template, study the numbered step-by-step examples. Read the code comments.
- Use the learning resources on the Lexaloffle website: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=resources
- The PICO-8 Fandom Wiki and https://nerdyteachers.com/PICO-8/ are other useful learning resources.
- Once you have reproduced the basic template, try adding new features.
- Expand on the template by building an original game. Center around a prompt or theme.

Teachers/Educators:
- This library is best used alongside regular instruction and a variety of additional learning resources.
- I like to teach students how to build the basic template for each set, step by step, then have students add new features themselves.
- The basic templates may be used by students as a reference as they are learning to build a game in that format.
- Some of the features may be useful for students who are looking to add something specific to their game (projectiles, pickups, etc.)
- The "misc_topics" set has examples on general features such as state machines, timers, etc.
