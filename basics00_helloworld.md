# helloworld
Explanation of basics00_helloworld.p8

A customary way to begin learning a new programming language is to display the text "hello world" on the screen  
This first example is very simple, requiring only two lines of code to run:  

cls() is a built-in PICO-8 function that clears the screen -- this removes the command line interface and refreshes the screen each frame  
print() is another built-in PICO-8 function, used for displaying text  

All functions require parentheses after the function name, but some functions can also be given values inside the parentheses  

print() requires the following values, in order, separated by commas:  

The text to print (inside quotes), the x coordinate of the screen location to print the text, the y coordinate  
Optionally, a fourth value can be given to specify the text color, as a numeric value from 0-15 (default is gray: 6)
