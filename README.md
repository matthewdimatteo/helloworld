# helloworld
A PICO-8 library for beginner programmers to learn the basics of coding

This library is intended foremost as an educational tool. Please feel free to use this code in your own projects however you choose. However, this code is not intended to be something you can mindlessly copy and paste; you will most likely need to adapt it to your own projects, requiring a basic understanding of how it works. I try to comment without over-commenting, so accompanying each file will be a readme with a more detailed explanation of how the code in that file works. Again, the goal for this project is education. Whether you are a student or an educator, I hope you find it useful. The library will likely grow over time, so feel free to request a new feature if you can't find what you're looking for.
